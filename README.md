### Week 2
### ------------------

In this week I was sick so sadly I didn't do as much as I hoped for but my main focus was on learning to use c++ for building the main character and the portal

- Learned c++ for unreal engine - 1.5 hour (did a lot of reaserch on the different classes and commands such as translating unreal engine's structors into code or printing to the screen)
- Implemented the basic movements in c++ (walk,turb,jump) - 2 hours (had some bugs revolving the compiletion that took me quite a lot of work and luck to understand)
- Continued to work on the first level - 
- Tried to work more on the basic character animations - 1.5 hour (had some problems in blender trying to animate walking naturally - had several different skeleton attempts)
- Planned how to implement the portals and strated to write code for them - 1 hour (had to juggle between the character and the portal in order to implement basic code for them, also planned how to make different portals.)
