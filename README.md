I made the main screen & the options menu.

* Cube model+animation - 1 hour (took time to make each one of the 27 unique cubes and animate it to spin)
* Make the sky box - 1 hour (had some problems with the materials and the creation)
* The main menu itself  - 1 hour (logo,functional buttons, add the model)
* Options menu - 1 hour (28 buttons, each one focus on a different setting)
* Make other models+their animations - 1 hour (platforms,small cubes, characters, etc..)

### Week 2
### ------------------

In this week I was sick so sadly I didn't do as much as I hoped for but my main focus was on learning to use c++ for building the main character and the portal

- Learned c++ for unreal engine - 2 hour (did a lot of reaserch on the different classes and commands such as translating unreal engine's structors into code or printing to the screen)
- Implemented the basic movements in c++ (walk,turb,jump) - 2 hours (had some bugs revolving the compiletion that took me quite a lot of work and luck to understand)
- Continued to work on the first level - 2 hours
- Tried to work more on the basic character animations - 2 hour (had some problems in blender trying to animate walking naturally - had several different skeleton attempts)
- Planned how to implement the portals and strated to write code for them - 1 hour (had to juggle between the character and the portal in order to implement basic code for them, also planned how to make different portals.)

### Week 3
### ------------------
- dealt with bugs with the engine itself - 6 hours, I experienced at least 3 different bugs that relate to the engine like the engine not letting me open my project or the engine not agreeing to compile anymore after one fatal bug. Each one of them I worked hard to find a solution to and/or rebuild my project
- built a working portal (learning+implementation) - 1 hour, the player uses them to teleport from one place to another
- Worked on collectables (learning+implementation) - 1 hour. started working on the c++ class and learn how to implement using overlapping
- Worked on using widgets through the engine - 1 hour. Tried different methods and tested them.

### Week 4
### ------------------
- Worked on lighting & materials:  1 hour (made sure the walls and object can be seen well in a giant room without using lamps, also gave fitting textures
to objects fox example metalic texture to coins or glowing for certan objects)
- Worked on stats for the player: 1.5 hours (stats such as number of deaths, number of rooms visited, number of coins collected etc...)
- Worked on some widgets: 1 hour (widgets such as a hud or a "press interact to use" near objects the user can interact with)
- Started working on platforms: 1.5 hour (special black platform that kills the player, blue one that forces the player to walk etc...)
- Finished the collectables & tested both them and portals: 1 hour (made sure the collectable interact with the stats, and work according to their use)
- Started working on the first level: 1 hour (build it from blocks, put the coins in the right place, etc...)
